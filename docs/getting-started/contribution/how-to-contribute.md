# üèó How to contribute

## Introduction

Each user is welcome to contribute to our library. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, your contributions play a vital role in the enhancement of our library. Below, we outline the various ways you can get involved and make a positive impact.

## Issues

If you encounter a bug, have a feature request, or have any other questions, you are encouraged to [open an issue](https://github.com/dl-solarity/solidity-lib/issues/new/choose). When doing so, please provide a detailed explanation of your concern or suggestion. It's also helpful to review existing issues to avoid duplicates. Once your issue is submitted, our team will review it and connect with you for any further discussion or clarification.

## Discussions

For suggestions or topics that require more nuanced conversation, feel free to [start a discussion](https://github.com/orgs/dl-solarity/discussions/new/choose). Think of it as a forum where you can share ideas, create polls, and engage in discussions about a wide range of topics, even those not directly related to the library.

## Pull Requests

If you're interested in contributing code to our library, start by [forking a repository](https://github.com/dl-solarity/solidity-lib/fork) and [creating a pull request](https://github.com/dl-solarity/solidity-lib/compare). Before you start coding, we highly recommend that you open an issue or start a discussion first to confirm the changes you want to make. This approach ensures your contributions align with our project's objectives. Additionally, please make sure to thoroughly read our [Solidity](solidity) and [Tests](tests.md) guidelines. Adhering to these guidelines is crucial for maintaining the quality and consistency of our codebase.
