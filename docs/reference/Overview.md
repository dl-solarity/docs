# Overview

Our source code is extensively documented with [NatSpec](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html) comments, providing detailed descriptions for all contracts, libraries, functions, and more. Leveraging our [hardhat-markup](https://github.com/dl-solarity/hardhat-markup) plugin, we transform these comments into a structured documentation in Markdown (`.md`) format. The result is an accurate, easy-to-navigate documentation that mirrors the latest state of our codebase.
